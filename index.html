   <p>I first got interested in coding when I was younger. My first time playing with code was when I was a sophmore in Highschool, I was 16 at the time.
   The first compiler I used was Visual Basic 2010. It was much easier than python in terms of making it user-friendly. From then on I have looked far
   and wide on the internet and in books to learn more about programming. I have attempted Java, Javascript, C++,C#, and even Visual Basic 2010 after
   a few years of not touching it. None of the material I had searched through made me feel like I actually learned it. I was able to get through the
   basic material up to Classes and Objects and I just couldn't get it to stick. Till LaunchCode that is, and that is where I am today.</p>

   <p>I'm hoping to use what I learn from this class to get me into Data Sciences like physics and astrophysics. Both of them, I think, requires someone
   to write the code needed to retrieve the data, sort it, and make it understandable to the naked eye. That's where I'm hoping to end up eventually in
   my career. Though I have though about going into Programming for major gaming companies or even indie companies, but I know I gotta start from the bottom
   and work my way till I have experience.</p>

   <p>For now though, I just have to stay with python and anything you guys (lc101 staff) throw at me. That's my story and hopefully this path won't lead
   to a dead end.</p>
